As required by the course project, `run_analysis.R` performs the following steps.

* Merges two data sets (train and the test) to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Features
As mentioned above, only the mean and standard deviation measurements were required for this project. More information about mean and standard measurements, as well as other variables are `features_info.txt`.

# Activities
The following activity labels were used as read from `activity_labels.txt`. 
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
